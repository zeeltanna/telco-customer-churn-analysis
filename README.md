# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project explores customer churn using the Telco dataset. It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling using logistic regression. The analysis provides insights into customer behavior and retention patterns, supported by visualizations and evaluation metrics. The notebook is beginner-friendly and serves as a foundation for more advanced churn prediction models.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as demographics, subscription services, tenure, billing, and churn status. It helps in understanding why customers leave a telecom service.

## ðŸ“Š Whatâ€™s included
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with plots and observations
- Feature engineering and encoding for modeling
- Logistic regression model to predict customer churn
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Insights and recommendations for reducing churn

## ðŸ›  Libraries used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
